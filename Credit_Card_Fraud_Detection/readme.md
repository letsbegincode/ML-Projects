## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. We utilize various techniques, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model optimization, to enhance the model's performance and reliability in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Objective
- **Binary Classification**: Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify credit card transactions as either genuine or fraudulent.
- **Handle Imbalance**: Implement techniques to address the class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring that the model can effectively detect fraudulent transactions even when they are rare.

## Significance
- **Financial Loss**: Accurate fraud detection can significantly reduce financial losses for both individuals and businesses.
- **Customer Protection**: By preventing fraudulent transactions, we can protect consumers from unauthorized charges and identity theft.
- **Industry Innovation**: The development of effective fraud detection models can drive innovation in the financial technology sector and contribute to the overall security of online transactions.
